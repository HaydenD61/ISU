This game is a 2D turn-based battle game where the player faces off against a series of five increasingly difficult enemies. In each battle, the player can choose between a basic attack, a powerful special attack that charges over time, or a one-time heal. Both the player and enemy take turns, with health bars and a combat log clearly showing the status of the fight. The game features simple but engaging combat mechanics, animated attack sequences, and victory/game over screens to mark progress. It is designed to be easy to play while offering strategic choices and satisfying progression.
